“Community networking”, also known as “bottom-up networking”, is an emerging model for the Future Internet, where communities of citizens build, operate and own open IP-based networks
        
In Southern Europe, Guifi.net [2] in Spain is a very large network consisting of more than 20,000 nodes andmore than 24,000 links. For
        
COMMUNITY-LAB To allow more research with community networks, theCommunity-Lab [15] testbed is being developed and oper- ated by the European FP7 CONFINE project (Commu- nity Networks Testbed for the Future Internet, FP7 In- tegrated Project 2011-2015) [16], federating existing com- munity networks. The goal of the testbed is supporting experimentally-driven research on community-owned open local IP networks. To achieve this goal, the CONFINE testbed integrates with and extends three existing commu- nity},
