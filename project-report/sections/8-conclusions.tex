\section{Conclusions}

In this work we have presented a pub-sub system for the distributed web.
We started out by presenting the motivation that has led us to this work,
defining a set of objectives that we seek for our system. We then documented our
literature review in the subject, classifying the reviewed systems accordingly.
After that we described our solution, considering all the literature and systems
studied previously. Finally, we presented the metrics that will allow us to
asses our solution and evaluate the quality of the work done.
