\begin{abstract}

The Publisher Subscriber paradigm is a wildly popular form of communication
in complex distributed systems. A lot of research exists around it, with
solutions ranging from centralised message brokers, to fully decentralised
scenarios. When we are focusing on scalability, decentralisation poses the
best option. There is however a clear lack of decentralised systems accounting
for reliability, message delivery guarantees and, more importantly, persistence.

To this end we present PulsarCast, a decentralised, highly scalable, pub-sub system
seeking to give guarantees that are traditionally associated with a centralised architecture
such as persistence and delivery guarantees.
