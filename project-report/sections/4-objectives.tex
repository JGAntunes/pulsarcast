\section{Objectives}

As we are going to cover in the next sections, lots of different
solutions exist. However, most of them either rely on a
centralised or hierarchic network to have a reliable system, with
stronger delivery and persistence guarantees, or end up sacrificing
these same properties in order to have a decentralised system with the
potential to scale to a much larger network.

The solution we propose is a pub-sub module to IPFS with a strong focus
on reliability, delivery guarantees and data persistence, while
maintaining the ability to scale to a vast number of users, using the
network infrastructure we have in place today. There is also, to the
best of our knowledge, a lack of pub-sub systems with such a strong
focus on persistence, which is something our solution does.
