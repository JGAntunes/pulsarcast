\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this work, we introduced Pulsarcast, a decentralised, topic-based, pub-sub
solution that seeks to bring reliability and eventual delivery guarantees
(commonly associated with centralised solutions) to the P2P realm. We analysed
how Pulsarcast provides a feature rich API on top of a system that leverages a
Kadmelia structured overlay to build immutable and content-addressable data
structures (Merkle DAG) representing both topics and events. These structures
power Pulsarcast's eventual delivery guarantees.

<TODO>

We concluded that our system provides a very nice alternative to applications
that seek a better QoS level as well as a feature-rich topology setting, that
allows to restrict publishers and configure topics to one's needs. Despite
being heavily reliant on a structured overlay, Pulsarcast did not underperform
under adverse network conditions, making it suitable for multiple scenarios.
