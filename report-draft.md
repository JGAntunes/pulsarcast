# Introduction

The publish/subscribe message pattern is an approach that has received an increasing amount of attention recently. This is mainly due to its special properties, that allow for full decoupling of all the communicating parts. First let's define what the publish/subscribe pattern is. In this interaction scheme, subscribers (or consumers) sign up for events, or classes of events, from publishers (or producers) that are subsequently asynchronously delivered. Taking a closer look at this definition you'll see that this comes hand in hand with the way information is consumed nowadays, with the exponential growth of social networks like Twitter and the usage of feeds such as RSS.

The previously discussed decoupling can be broken in three different parts. The decoupling in time, space and synchronisation.  The time decoupling comes from the fact that publishers and subscribers do not need to be interacting with each other at the same time, this means that the publisher can publish some events while the subscriber is disconnected and the subscriber can be notified of an event whose publisher is disconnected. Space decoupling gives the both parties the benefit of not needing to know each other in order to communicate, given that consumers and producers are focused on they're specific roles (consuming/producing) and don't care for who's doing what, or how many producers are for example. Synchronization decoupling is a consequence of the asynchronous nature of the pub/sub pattern, as publishers don't need to be blocked while producing events and subscribers can be asynchronously notified. The decoupling that this kind of system offers makes it the ideal candidate for very large networks that need a way to communicate in a efficient way. 

Due to properties described above, a lot of applications rely on the publish/subscribe paradigm and a lot of work as been done by companies like Twitter and LinkedIn into making these systems highly scalable, with the creation of tools like Kafka, which aim at guaranteeing low latency and high event throughput. Other examples are the multiple message queue systems like Apache Active MQ, RabbitMQ, Redis, etc. These solutions are, of course, centralised and as such suffer from all the common issues that affect centralised solutions, it's quite hard to maintain and scale these systems to a lot of clients. Peer-to-Peer networks on the other hand, have proven numerous times, that this is where they shine, with examples such as Gnutella, Skype and most recently IPFS. All of these systems are a living proof of high scalability P2P can offer.

The solution we purpose is a pub/sub module with a strong focus on reliability, delivery guarantees and data persistence, while maintaining the ability to scale to a vast number of users, using the network infrastructure we have in place today. Our goal is to overcome the shortcomings of most of the solutions in place where, either we have to rely on a centralised or hierarchic network to have such guarantees, or we need to give up on some reliability aspects in order to have a decentralised system. There's also, to the best of our knowledge, a lack of pub sub systems with such a strong focus on persistence, which is something our solution does.

### Subscription Model

When considering Pub Sub systems, there's a set of different options that will lay ground for the behaviour of the whole system. We call these options, design dimensions. Specifically, in our case, one  of the biggest decisions when designing a pub sub system is what kind of subscription model to use.The subscription model determines how will subscribers set which events they're interested in. There are three large approaches covered by relevant literature and that implementations usually follow:

  * Topic based subscriptions
  * Content based subscriptions
  * Type based subscriptions

Topic based subscriptions employs, as the name states, the notion of topics or subjects to allow peers to subscribe to relevant content. These topics are identified by keywords and can be naturally viewed as a group or a channel to which peers can send messages (publish) and receive messages (subscribe). This approach was one of the earliest models in the pub sub paradigm, with references ([insert reference] TIBCO?), mainly due to its similarity with the group communication systems already in place at the time. Some examples of the topic based approach allow to build a topic hierarchy. A specific one is using a UNIX path like approach, which allow to build topic hierarchy just like paths in a file system. Consider as an example:

```
/fruits
/fruits/citrus
/fruits/citrus/orange
```

The list above is an example of 3 topics, that act as 3 different tiers on a hierarchy. This allows for specialisation and the possibility to extend the subscription structure already in place.

The content based subscription model brought a different approach that sought to use the content of the event message itself as way to subscribers to specify the messages they were interested in. Essentially, subscribers could define fields, or conditions on those same fields that would make an event part of a subscription or not. Consider the following example of a simple message and subscription, represented using JSON.

Message
```
{
  exchange: "Euronext Lisboa",
  company: "CTT",
  order: "buy",
  number: "100",
  price: "5.55",
}
```

Subscription
```
{
  exchange: "Euronext Lisboa",
  order: "buy",
  number: ">50",
  price: "<10",
}
```
The example above translates a subscription to a stock exchange system, where the client would receive all the event messages for buy orders of more than 50 stock actions for a maximum price of 10â‚¬. The notion of subscription is much more complex in this model, but allows for a much more powerful and accurate message filtering.

Also worth referencing is the type based subscription model. (Reference to Eugster). The type based model seeks to use the type scheme of a programming language without introducing a topic hierarchy. Instead it focus on the idea that, in practice, messages part of the same topic usually are of the same type and notify the same kind of event. As such we can rely on the straightforward type-safe interpretation of messages belonging to the same topic, since most topic based systems only offer, at most, weakly typed interfaces. This, of course, comes quite handy when working with strongly typed languages such as Java and C++. One other aspect also worth mentioning is that, similar to topic based systems, the type based system also offers a notion of hierarchy through sub-typing.

While looking back at these different models its crucial to understand how they are tied to the expressiveness of the system as a whole. Choosing a topic based subscription model will allow for an easier implementation when it comes to message filtering at each node, but it will clearly affect the capabilities of the system. On the other end, a content based subscription model allows for a lot more expressiveness in subscription definition, but it makes it a lot harder to implement a scalable way of filtering messages. It's also important to note that these three categories are not strict distinct models, its quite possible to have solutions in between, such as content based filtering through the use of special topics, or content based filtering only for pre-set fields. As such, not all approaches are easy to categorise and, for some specific scenarios and systems, the line is quite thin between the multiple subscription models.

It's also interesting to look at the application space and notice that not all applications have the same expressiveness requirements. This makes the existence of multiple subscription models not only justifiable but required. Consider the example given above for a stock exchange system, these kind of applications have a need for a complex set of subscription patterns, quite different from the ones you would probably have for a chat or social media application, which would rely heavily in the notion of topics and groups. 

### Network Architecture 

Independent of the subscription model used, the system approach to the network architecture is crucial as it will, not only set the way clients interact with it, but will also determine a lot of the properties that the solution will benefit from (such as scalability, reliability, etc.).

Based on the early work of Baran (ref to Paul Baran paper), one can categorize networks in centralised, decentralised and distributed.

(use Baran figure do illustrate the differences)

Note that the goal of a pub/sub system is to permit the exchange of events in a asynchronous manner, with the decoupling of producers from consumers as previously discussed. This can be easily achieved using an entity which is responsible for receiving the messages from the producers, storing it and distributing it through the consumers. This is what we refer to as a centralised architecture, motivated by the need of this central entity. This is the approach adopted by a lot of the message queue systems like Apache Active MQ, RabbitMQ and Redis. The usual focus for applications relying on this kind of systems is on reliability and data consistency but with a low data throughput.

The asynchronous needs of the pub/sub paradigm also allow for a different approach on message forwarding, with both producers and consumers being responsible for storing and forwarding messages, without the need of a intermediary entity. This approach is referred to as a distributed architecture as there is no central entity that could easily become a bottleneck for the whole system. It's also commonly referred to as peer to peer architecture, for it relies on the communication between peers in the same network. (reference for a distributed system). These kind of systems have a great focus on scalability and, consequently, on efficient message delivery.

Finally we have hybrid approaches to both of these extremes, were we rely on a distributed network of servers making the network topology resemble more of decentralised network as showed in figure (figure number). This is the approach followed by systems like Gryphon, Jedi and Siena, which rely on a network of broker nodes to perform the work of persisting and distributing the events in a reliable fashion.

### Overlay structure

Working with a distributed network architecture has its own set of challenges. When we rely on the communication between peers we need a way to create and maintain links between multiple nodes in a network. Hence the overlay networks. The idea is to have a structure of logical links and nodes, independent of the physical network beneath them that actually powers the communications through. Unlike traditional layer-3 networks, the structure of these overlays is not dictated by the fairly statical physical presence and connectivity of hosts, but by logical relationships between peers. This way we have the potential to manipulate the logical network at the application level, without needing to change the network backbone that connects the nodes. This approach was key to deploy P2P applications such as (give P2P application examples) on top of the existing Internet infrastructure.

(example image with the distinction between physical network and overlay network)

In practical terms, each node maintains a view of its neighbours in the overlay network, which translates into the communication links between them. There are different approaches to the way this state is stored and maintained, with two main categories dominating the P2P ecosystem. At one end of the spectrum we have the unstructured overlay networks, where peers form a network with no clear structure or hierarchy (commonly referred to as a network mesh) with each peer connected to a subset of other nodes independent of their id, localisation, network ip address, etc.

Unstructured overlays rely on membership protocols that try to preserve a couple of key properties, such as the network diameter and its average degree. A great amount of these membership protocols use gossip based (also referred to as epidemic) approaches in order to do this. These approaches exploit properties that arise when information is disseminated in a random, or close to random, way. These probabilistic approaches help keeping the overlay connected in the event of network failures. Such example is Cyclon, a membership protocol that uses a gossip based approach to help maintain a network which resembles a random graph (reference to random graph paper) in terms of degree distribution, clustering coefficient and path length. In order to do this, the approach followed by Cyclon is to, at each node, besides keeping a fixed size of neighbours (other nodes in the network), it also keeps information to when was the last time that node was contacted. Periodically, each node contacts the oldest node of its neighbours (i.e. the node which has been the longest time without being contacted) and shares with it a fixed size partial list of its neighbours, to which the contacted peer replies back with its own partial view of its neighbours. Each node updates its neighbours list with the new info (either by filling empty cache slots or by replacing entries that were sent in the previous contact). It's also worth noting that during this exchange, the node that initiated the contact will drop the contacted node of its neighbour list, as the contacted node will inversely add the node that established contact to his. This way we end up with a uniform and organic way to disseminate node information across the network. This approach is based on a technique entitled shuffling (reference to shuffling).

The unstructured overlay has an interesting set of properties, such as its ability to accommodate for a highly dynamic network with a high resilience to network failures and churn (i.e. high volumes of changes in network participants). However, the lack of structure in the network usually limits the kind of queries for content one can run through. The delivery of messages in the network will always follow a probabilistic best effort approach. Finally, unstructured gossip based approaches rely on a pre-set of conditions that, if not met accordingly, may affect the whole behaviour of the system (reference to "How robust are gossip-based communication protocols?"). For example, the selection of neighbours is a key aspect and should assume a random or pseudo-random fashion. If disturbed by a small set of nodes that could either be malfunctioning or behaving selfishly, the basic properties of the network like its resilience could be severely affected.

### Systems

#### Gryphon 
Gryphon relies on a broker based network to build a content based subscription system. In the Gryphon approach, subscriptions take the form of a schema consisting of attributes, such as A1,..., An, and are stored in the form of a tree. A subscription specifying a value V1 to the first attribute of the schema, A1, will follow from the tree root the edge labeled with V1. If no such edge exists, one will be created. For Ai = Vi, the subscription will follow at level i - 1 the edge with label Vi. If a subscription does not name an attribute at level i, then it will follow the edge with label * (do not care).

#### Jedi

Jedi too relies on a broker based network to build a content based pub/sub system. It developed a tree topology of broker nodes, where users were associated with leaf brokers and usersâ€™ subscriptions and events were first directed to their associated brokers. During subscription processing, subscriptions were directed up the leaf-to-root path, leaving at each intermediate node some state. During event processing, events also followed the leaf-to- root path. This guaranteed that any event and any subscription would rendezvous at (least at) the root. Any incoming event would therefore be matched against all subscriptions that have passed through each broker, this guaranteed that no subscription matching an event would go undetected. Also, while events were travelling towards the root, subscription matching could happen at each broker and events would be sent down the tree if needed be.

Design dimensions are the design decisions that define how our system works.

- Design dimensions:
  - Subscription model (topic based, content based, etc.) - this directly affects the expressiveness of the system
  - Architecture (centralised, hierarchical, distributed, etc.)
  - Topology (in a distributed scenario, e.g. broker mesh, p2p, ...)
  - Overlay structure (the structure of the overlay(s) used - if any - where unstructered is a specific scenario)
  - Subscription management (representation, propagation?)
  - Event dissemination (routing, propagation)
  
Event dissemination and subscription management in the end might use the same mechanisms.
(?) still need to better define/separate architecture vs topology

Relevant properties are goals/special focuses that systems define as something they want to reach or give. These can be obtained by making the appropriate design decisions (see above).

- Relevant Properties:
  - Topology related:
    - Locality awareness
    - Relay free routing
  - Application related:
    - Delivery guarantees under normal conditions (when the system and network works as expected)
    - Fault tolerance mechanisms (delivery guarantees under churn, ability to keep network overlay structure when relevant nodes (or a great deal of nodes) leave the network)

Relevant metrics are metrics that are a consequence of the design decisions made above and provide a good overview on how well the solution fits a certain usage scenario.

- Relevant Metrics
  - Average network degree
  - Message duplication factor
  - Message usefulness ratio (operational msgs vs actual messages relevant for the applications)

# Purposed solution

(Oudated stuff, missing the whole solution purposed on e-mail)

## IPFS

### P2P diagram

As per what we discussed, the desired capabilities of our system will be a highly reliable system with high robustness under churn, that uses IPLD and possibly IPNS to provide a way for events to not only be persisted but also gives the peers a way to validate their data stream and request missing blocks of information. This can power applications like document collaboration tools, or chat applications with multiple levels of threads happening at once.
(?) Need to better define the schema for the IPLD graph, since I think the way I might be seeing things might not be right.
