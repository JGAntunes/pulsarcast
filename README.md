## Project Description

**Abstract**

The publish-subscribe paradigm is a wildly popular form of communication incomplex distributed systems. A lot of research exists around it, with solutionsranging from centralised message brokers, to fully decentralised scenarios(peer to peer). When we are focusing on scalability, decentralisation poses thebest option. There is, however, a clear lack of decentralised systemsaccounting for reliability, message delivery guarantees and, more importantly,persistence.  To this end, we present Pulsarcast, a decentralised, highlyscalable, pub-sub system seeking to give guarantees that are traditionallyassociated with a centralised architecture such as persistence and eventualdelivery guarantees.
