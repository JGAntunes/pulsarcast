Notes for my master thesis @ IST

## Possible topics to cover

* [S3-backed IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/214) - (might be too simple/ not that interesting for a project like this?)
* [Real world IPFS scenarios we want to test](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/211) - (goal might be to build an application which enables us to test some of the desired metrics here and extract conclusions on how well IPFS performs under certain scenarios?)
* [Making IPFS accessible for distributed archival](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/210)
* [DSL for specifying a libp2p node](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/209)
* [IPFS and package managers](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/171)
* [Discussions and Planning about getting PubSub on IPFS/libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/research-pubsub)
