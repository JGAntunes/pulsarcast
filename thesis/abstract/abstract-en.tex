The publish-subscribe paradigm is a wildly popular form of communication
in complex distributed systems. A lot of research exists around it, with
solutions ranging from centralised message brokers, to fully decentralised
scenarios (peer to peer). When we are focusing on scalability, decentralisation poses the
best option. There is, however, a clear lack of decentralised systems accounting
for reliability, message delivery guarantees and, more importantly, persistence.
To this end, we present PulsarCast, a decentralised, highly scalable, pub-sub system
seeking to give guarantees that are traditionally associated with a centralised
architecture such as persistence and eventual delivery guarantees.
