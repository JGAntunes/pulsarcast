abstract = {In this paper, we argue that there is a need for an event-based middleware to build large-scale distributed systems. Existing publish/subscribe systems still have limitations compared to invocation-based middlewares. We introduce Hermes, a novel event-based distributed middleware architecture that follows a type- and attribute-based publish/subscribe model. It centres around the notion of an event type and supports features commonly known from object-oriented languages like type hierarchies and super-type subscriptions. A scalable routing algorithm using an overlay routing network is presented that avoids global broadcasts by creating rendezvous nodes. Fault-tolerance mechanisms that can cope with different kinds of failures in the middleware are integrated with the routing algorithm resulting in a scalable and robust system.},

abstract = {Well adapted to the loosely coupled nature of distributed interaction in large-scale applications, the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has recently received increasing attention.With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization.We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.},

abstract = {Content-based subscription systems are an emerging alternative to traditional publish-subscribe systems, because they permit more flexible subscriptions along multiple dimensions. In these systems, each subscription is a predicate which may test arbitrary attributes within an event. However, the matching problem for content-based systems - determining for each event the subset of all subscriptions whose predicates match the event - is still an open problem. We present an efficient, scalable solution to the matching problem. Our solution has an expected time complexity that is sub-linear in the number of subscriptions, and it has a space complexity that is linear. Specifically, we prove that for predicates reducible to conjunctions of elementary tests, the expected time to match a random event is no greater than O(N1-{\&}lambda;) where N is the number of subscriptions, and {\&}lambda; is a closed-form expression that depends on the number and type of attributes (in some cases, {\&}lambda;{\&}asyum;1/2). We present some optimizations to our algorithms that improve the search time.

abstract = {This paper briefly reviews the distributed communication network concept in which each station is connected to all adjacent stations rather than to a few switching points, as in a centralized system. The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point. ER -},

The construction of these overlays, which is essentially a membership management issue, is crucial. Ideally, the resulting overlays should have low diameter and be resilient to massive node failures, which are both characteristic properties of random graphs. In addition, they should be able to deal with a high node churn (i.e., expect high-frequency membership changes). Inexpensive membership management while retaining random-graph properties is therefore important. In this paper, we describe a novel gossip-based membership management protocol that meets these requirements. Our protocol is shown to construct graphs that have low diameter, low clustering, highly symmetric node degrees, and that are highly resilient to massive node failures. Moreover, we show that the protocol is highly reactive to restoring randomness when a large number of nodes fail.},

abstract = {BMTP offers rate controlled multicast with reliability, high throughput, and support for large numbers of receivers. A multicast sender needs feedback from receivers to recover from errors and to choose an appropriate send rate, but must avoid being overwhelmed as the number of receivers grows. BMTP does this by keeping the rate at which each receiver sends feedback inversely proportional to a running estimate of the number of receivers. BMTP bases its send rate on the minimum of the receive rates observed by the receivers, causing the sender to slow down in the face of packet loss or competing traffic, and to speed up when there is spare network capacity. BMTP�s NAK-based retransmission rarely sends any data more than twice, a substantial improvement over iterated unicast. Rabin�s Information Dispersal Algorithm can reduce this re-send rate as close as desired to the underlying loss rate of the network. Simulations with 1000 receivers substantiate these claims.},

Pastry performs application-level routing and object location in a po- tentially very large overlay network of nodes connected via the Internet. It can be used to support a variety of peer-to-peer applications, including global data storage, data sharing, group communication and naming. Each node in the Pastry network has a unique identifier (nodeId). When presented with a message and a key, a Pastry node efficiently routes the message to the node with a nodeId that is numerically closest to the key, among all currently live Pastry nodes. Each Pastry node keeps track of its immediate neighbors in the nodeId space, and notifies applications of new node arrivals, node failures and recoveries. Pastry takes into account network locality; it seeks to minimize the distance messages travel, according to a to scalar proximity metric like the number of IP routing hops. Pastry is completely decentralized, scalable, and self-organizing; it automatically adapts to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation on an emulated network of up to 100,000 nodes confirm Pastry's scalability and efficiency, its ability to self-organize and adapt to node failures, and its good network locality properties.},

abstract = {The completely decoupled interaction model offered by the publish/subscribe communication paradigm perfectly suits the interoperability needs of todays large-scale, dy-namic, peer-to-peer applications. The unmanaged envi-ronments, where these applications are expected to work, pose a series of problems (potentially wide number of par-tipants, low-reliability of nodes, absence of a centralized authority, etc.) that severely limit the scalability of exist-ing approaches which were originally thought for support-ing distributed applications built on the top of static and managed environments. In this paper we propose an archi-tecture for implementing the topic-based publish/subscribe paradigm in large scale peer-to-peer systems. The archi-tecture is based on clustering peers subscribed to the same topic. The major novelty of this architecture lies in the mechanism employed to bring events from the publisher to the cluster (namely outer-cluster routing). The evaluation shows that this mechanism for outer-cluster routing has a probability to bring events to the destination cluster very close to 1 while keeping small the involved number of out-of-cluster peers. Finally, the overall architecture is shown to be scalable along several fundamental dimensions like number of participants, subscriptions, and to exhibit a fair load distribution (load distribution closely follows the dis-tribution of subscriptions on nodes).},

Producers pub- lish message objects on a communication bus, and con- sumers subscribe to the bus by specifying the types of the objects they are interested in. Message objects are consid- ered as first class citizens and are classified by their types, instead of arbitrarily fixed topics. By reusing the type scheme of the language to classify message objects, type-based publish/subscribe avoids any unnatural subscription scheme and provides for a seamless integration of a publish/subscribe middleware with the pro- gramming language. Type-based publish/subscribe has sev- eral quantifiable advantages over other publish/subscribe variants. In particular, the knowledge of the type of message objects enforces performance optimizations when combined with dynamic filters for content-based subscription. Our type-based publish/subscribe prototype is based on Distributed Asynchronous Collections (DACs), program- ming abstractions for publish/subscribe interaction. They are implemented using GJ, an extended Java compiler adding genericity to the Java language, and enable the ex- pression of safely typed distributed interaction without re- quiring any generation of typed proxies.},

Other proposed solutions that scale to larger numbers of receivers do so by restricting the multicast service model to be single-sourced. In this pa- per, we propose an application-level multicast scheme capable of scaling to large group sizes without restricting the service model to a single source. Our scheme builds on recent work on Content-Addressable Networks (CANs). Extending the CANframework to support multicast comes at trivial additional cost and, because of the structured nature of CAN topologies, obviates the need for a multicast routing algorithm. Given the deployment of a distributed infrastructure such as a CAN, we believe our CAN-based multicast scheme offers the dual advantages of simplicity and scalability. 1},

Many existing pubsystems are based on pre-defined subjects, and hence are able to exploit multicast technologies to provide scalability and availability. An emerging alternative to subject-based systems, known as content-based systems, allow information consumers to request events based on the content of published events. This model is considerably more flexible than subject-based pubsub. However, it was previously not known how to efficiently multicast published events to interested content-based subscribers within a large and geographically distributed network of broker (or router) machines. We develop and evaluate a novel and efficient distributed algorithm for this purpose, called -link matching”. Link matching performs just enough computation at each node to determine the subset of links to which an event should be forwarded. We show via simulations that: link matching yields higher throughput than flooding when subscriptions are selective; and the overall CPU utilization of link matching is comparable to that of centralized matching},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of constructing scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. Publish/subscribe systems are asynchronous event-notification systems in which a published event is forwarded to exactly those nodes that have previously subscribed for that event. Subscriptions can range from a simple specification of merely the type of an event to a specification of the value ranges that an event's attributes can have. Notably the latter poses potential scalability problems. Structured peer-to-peer systems can provide scalable solutions to publish/subscribe systems with simple subscription patterns. For complex subscription types their applicability is less obvious. In this paper, we present Sub-2-Sub, a collaborative self-organizing publish/subscribe system deploying an unstructured overlay network. Sub-2-Sub relies on an epidemic-based algorithm in which peers continuously exchange subscription information to get clustered to similar peers. In contrast to many existing approaches, Sub-2-Sub supports both value-based and interval-based subscriptions. Simulations of Sub-2-Sub on synthetic and reusable workloads convey its good properties in terms of routing efficiency, fairness, accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Overlay networks are central to the operation of large-scale decentralized applications, be it Internet-scale P2P systems deployed in the wild or cloud applications running in a controlled—albeit large-scale—environment. A number of custom solutions exist for individual applications, each employing a tailor-made mechanism to build and maintain its specific structure. This paper addresses the role of randomness in developing and maintaining such structures. Taking VICINITY, a generic overlay management framework based on self-organization, we explore tradeoffs between deterministic and probabilistic decision-making for structuring overlays. We come to the conclusion that a pinch of randomness may even be needed in overlay construction, but also that much randomness or randomness alone is not good either.},

abstract = {Overcast is an application-level multicasting system that can be incrementally deployed using today's Internet infrastructure. These properties stem from Overcast's implementation as an overlay network. An overlay network consists of a collection of nodes placed at strategic locations in an existing network fabric. These nodes implement a network abstrac- tion on top of the network provided by the under- lying substrate network. Overcast provides scalable and reliable single-source multicast using a simple protocol for building effi- cient data distribution trees that adapt to changing network conditions. To support fast joins, Overcast implements a new protocol for efficiently tracking the global status of a changing distribution tree. Results based on simulations confirm that Over- cast provides its added functionality while perform- ing competitively with IP Multicast. Simulations indicate that Overcast quickly builds bandwidth- efficient distribution trees that, compared to IP Multicast, provide 70{\%}-100{\%} of the total band- width possible, at a cost of somewhat less than twice the network load.},

@article{Kermarrec2013,
abstract = {Increasingly, one of the most prominent ways to disseminate information on the Web is through "notifications" (also known as alerts), and as such they are at the core of many large-scale applications. For instance, users are notified of articles in which they are interested through RSS feeds, of posts from their friends through social networks, or of recommendation generated by various sites. Event notification usually relies on the so-called Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB) communication paradigm. In PUB/SUB systems, subscribers sign up for events or classes of events in order to be asynchronously notified afterward by the system. The size of such systems (with respect to events and subscriptions) keeps growing, and providing scalable implementations of PUB/SUB systems is extremely challenging. Although there exist popular examples of centralized PUB/SUB systems that currently support a large number of subscribers, such as online social networks, they periodically face formidable challenges due to peak loads and do not always offer a support for fine-grain subscriptions. In fact, providing scalability along with expressiveness in the subscription patterns calls for distributed implementations of PUB/SUB systems. In parallel, peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks have emerged, providing a sound and highly scalable network foundation upon which to build distributed applications including PUB/SUB systems. In this article, we focus on fully decentralized (P2P), highly scalable, PUB/SUB systems. More specifically, we investigate how PUB/SUB and P2P research can be integrated. We define the design space and explore it in a systematic way. We expose an understanding of available design choices; provide a comprehensive classification and understanding of prominent P2P PUB/SUB systems, positioning them against the design dimensions; and highlight correlations between and implications, benefits, and shortcomings of design alternatives.

Scribe is built on top of Pastry, a generic peer-to-peer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the Internet, and leverages Pastry's reliability, self-organization, and locality properties. Pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group. Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees, and we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability. Simulation results, based on a realistic network topology model, show that Scribe scales across a wide range of groups and group sizes. Also, it balances the load on the nodes while achieving acceptable delay and link stress when compared with Internet protocol multicast.},

@article{Carzaniga2003,
abstract = {The components of a loosely coupled system are typically designed to operate by generating and responding to asynchronous events. An event notification service is an application-independent infrastructure that supports the construction of event-based systems, whereby generators of events publish event notifications to the infrastructure and consumers of events subscribe with the infrastructure to receive relevant notifications. The two primary services that should be provided to components by the infrastructure are notification selection (i. e., determining which notifications match which subscriptions) and notification delivery (i.e., routing matching notifications from publishers to subscribers). Numerous event notification services have been developed for local-area networks, generally based on a centralized server to select and deliver event notifications. Therefore, they suffer from an inherent inability to scale to wide-area networks, such as the Internet, where the number and physical distribution of the service's clients can quickly overwhelm a centralized solution. The critical challenge in the setting of a wide-area network is to maximize the expressiveness in the selection mechanism without sacrificing scalability in the delivery mechanism. This paper presents SIENA, an event notification service that we have designed and implemented to exhibit both expressiveness and scalability. We describe the service's interface to applications, the algorithms used by networks of servers to select and deliver event notifications, and the strategies used to optimize performance. We also present results of simulation studies that examine the scalability and performance of the service.},

@article{Cugola2001,
abstract = {The development of complex distributed systems demands for the creation of suitable architectural styles (or paradigms) and related runtime infrastructures. An emerging style that is receiving increasing attention is based on the notion of event. In an event-based architecture, distributed software components interact by generating and consuming events. An event is the occurrence of some state change in a component of a software system, made visible to the external world. The occurrence of an event in a component is asynchronously notified to any other component that has declared some interest in it. This paradigm (usually called ¿publish/subscribe,¿ from the names of the two basic operations that regulate the communication) holds the promise of supporting a flexible and effective interaction among highly reconfigurable, distributed software components. In the past two years, we have developed an object-oriented infrastructure called JEDI (Java Event-Based Distributed Infrastructure). JEDI supports the development and operation of event-based systems and has been used to implement a significant example of distributed system, namely, the OPSS workflow management system (WFMS). The paper illustrates the main features of JEDI and how we have used them to implement OPSS. Moreover, the paper provides an initial evaluation of our experiences in using the event-based architectural style and a classification of some of the event-based infrastructures presented in the literature.},

Currently, there is no efficient means within the Internet to scalably deliver web objects under hot spot conditions to all clients that desire the object. We present PROOFS: a simple, lightweight, peer-to-peer (P2P) approach that uses randomized overlay construction and randomized, scoped searches to efficiently locate and deliver objects under heavy demand to all users that desire them. We evaluate PROOFS' robustness in environments in which clients join and leave the P2P network as well as in environments in which clients are not always fully cooperative. Through a mix of analytical modeling, simulation, and prototype experimentation in the Internet, we show that randomized approaches like PROOFS should effectively relieve flash crowd symptoms in dynamic, limited-participation environments.},
